# profile-page-project
For your first project, you'll practice web design skills by customizing a web page to create a personal profile. You'll modify the code for a basic web page by adding graphics, custom text, and a stylish design. This is an excellent way for you to practice HTML and CSS skills. It also gives you a web page you can use as a personal online calling card to advertise your experience, skills, and goals and provide links to your social media accounts on Twitter, LinkedIn, and GitHub.
