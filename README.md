# Profile Page
For my first project, I will practice web design skills by customizing a web page to create a personal profile. I modified the code for a basic web page by adding graphics, custom text, and a stylish design. This is an excellent way for me to practice HTML and CSS skills. It also gives me a web page you can use as a personal online calling card to advertise my experience, skills, and goals and provide links to your social media accounts on Twitter, LinkedIn, and GitHub.
